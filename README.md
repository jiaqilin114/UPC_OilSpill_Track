Sanchi oil spill drift prediction results. The yellow region indicates the ground truth oil spill region. The cyan region surrounded by dash lines indicates the prediction result by using numerically forecasted sea surface dynamic fields, and the cyan region surrounded by solid lines indicates the prediction result by using corrected sea surface dynamic fields.
